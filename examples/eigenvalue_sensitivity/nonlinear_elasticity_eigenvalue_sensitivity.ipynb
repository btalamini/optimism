    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The vibration characteristics of linear systems do not change with the applied loads (by definition). However, real systems often do have nonlinear effects that influence their spectrum. Quantifying these sensitivities can be useful for determining design margins and for designing structures and meta-materials to have useful filtering properties. This notebook explores this idea in a simple problem and illustrates how the tools of OptimiSM and Jax can be brought to bear.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook generalizes the previous example to the spectral analysis of a finitely deformed, hyperelastic structure. In doing so, we will get a glimpse at one of the nonlinear optimization-based solvers in OptimiSM. It concludes with a more interesting nonlinear eigenvalue sensitivity that requires an adjoint solve."

There are at least two factors shifting the frequency: (1) the Neo-Hookean model gets stiffer with increased stretch, which tends to increase the natural frequency; (2) the mass moment of inertia of the plate increases, since the mass distribution is now spread further from the fixed point at the root. This last effect should tend to decrease the natural frequency. Apparently, the stiffening effect dominates in this case.\n",
